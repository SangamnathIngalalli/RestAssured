## Flow Diagram Explanation
The flow diagram you provided in fig.txt perfectly illustrates the process implemented in these separate components:

1. Load Credentials - Handled by AwsCredentialsManager.loadGimmeAwsCredentials()
2. Create unique message with ID - Handled by SnsMessageSender.createJsonMessage()
3. Initialize SNS client with creds - Done in the SnsMessageSender constructor
4. Publish message to SNS topic - Handled by SnsMessageSender.sendMessage()
5. Initialize SQS client with creds - Done in the SqsMessageReceiver constructor
6. Wait for message propagation - Implemented with a sleep in the example
7. Check SQS queue for message - Handled by SqsMessageReceiver.waitForMessage()
8. Verify message was found - Done in the example with a boolean check
